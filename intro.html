<p>The Malaysian Public Library, Research and Development Centre (formerly known as the Malayan Public Library Association) 
was formed in 1955. Since then, this historical library has made immense contributions to the mental and intellectual 
development of Malaysians, both in the urban and non-urban areas. It has had a chequered history of providing reading 
materials and information services for the upliftment of the young and old through times of trouble and social instability. 
Presently it is located on the 2nd floor, Wisma HELP, Jalan Dungun 50490 Kuala Lumpur. 
The library, a non-profit organization, is managed by a Council of Board Members. The financial 
support comes mainly from members’ subscription fees and donations from the public. In 2002, HELP 
University College was invited to join the Council and to provide financial support as well as 
manpower to manage the library. Currently, it has a collection of over 60,000 books, mostly in 
Chinese. The subjects cover a wide range from classical and modern literature to current topics of 
interest. Most of the non-Chinese books were donated by the library members and the Chinese community.

The management would like to encourage the Chinese community, students and other interested members of the public to come and 
enjoy the library’s full range of facilities as an important complement to their formal and informal education. </p>
